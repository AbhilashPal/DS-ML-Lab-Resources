# DS&ML Learning Resources

### Data Structures and Algorithms :
The following resources are for learning basic Algorithm/Data-Structures Stuff that is invaluable for any field of CS. We shall need lots of basic concepts from these domains and a strong base in this regard is required for serious research in any subfield of CS, especially math/computation intensive fields like Data Science and ML/DL.
